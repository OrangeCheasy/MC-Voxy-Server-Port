/**
 * Per-dimension region freshness stamps (region-summary-sync-plan.md §3/§5): for each
 * region file, the last observed mtime, a memoized copy of the region header's per-chunk
 * save-second table (the 8 KiB {@code readHeaderTimestamps} shape the store sweep
 * pioneered — {@code int[1024]}, z-major), and a {@code liveSaveMark} bumped by the
 * dirty-mark choke point at save/edit SUBMISSION time.
 *
 * <p>P1 consumer: the disk reader's header freshness rung —
 * {@link #chunkStampSecondsOrUnknown} answers "content at this position last changed no
 * later than second S" so a ts&gt;0 resync whose client stamp is strictly newer (plus the
 * caller's serve-latency margin) can be answered {@code up_to_date} without the region
 * read. Every rung fails toward STALE (serving): unresolvable dimension, missing or
 * unreadable region file, absent chunk (header location 0), and degenerate header
 * seconds all report {@link #NEVER_CLEAN} or {@link #UNKNOWN}, which no client stamp
 * can beat. ALL doubt states are horizon-cached sentinels — a corrupt file or an
 * unresolvable dimension costs one stat per {@code STAT_HORIZON}, never one per ask.
 *
 * <p><b>The mark LATCH</b> (P1 review MAJOR — the write-pending race): the mark is
 * stamped when a change is SUBMITTED (Fabric's copyOf hook, Paper's edit events), but
 * the change reaches the region header later. While
 * {@code liveSaveMark > maxHeaderSecond} — a marked change no examined header reflects
 * yet — the whole region answers {@link #NEVER_CLEAN}: comparing client stamps against
 * a mark TIME is unsound, because a read that raced the pending write hands out an
 * acquisition stamp NEWER than the mark while carrying pre-change bytes. The latch
 * self-clears when the write lands (mtime change → header re-read raises
 * {@code maxHeaderSecond} to at least the write second ≥ the mark second). Once
 * cleared, per-chunk header seconds answer alone — the mark never degrades the region's
 * other 1023 chunks permanently. The unrelated-same-region-save corner (a sibling
 * chunk's same-second landing clearing the latch while the marked chunk's own write is
 * still queued) is closed by the clear-side GRACE — see {@code latchedOrInGrace}; the
 * serve-latency margin does NOT absorb it (it bounds acquisition-stamp skew, never
 * write-landing lag).
 *
 * <p>Threading: read by the disk reader pool (stat + header IO happen there, never on
 * the processing thread — and BEFORE the disk-read gate: a deliberate exemption, the
 * memoized cost is one stat per region per horizon), bumped by dirty-mark producers on
 * arbitrary threads (Fabric's save hook may run off-main under C2ME/Moonrise; Paper
 * events arrive on region threads under Folia). All state is concurrent; the per-entry
 * refresh is synchronized so one thread reads a changed header, not N — and every doubt
 * state is a cached sentinel, so the monitor is never a per-ask IO funnel.
 *
 * <p>Memory: the permanent per-region record is ~64 B; the memoized {@code int[1024]}
 * header snapshots (4 KiB each) are bounded by {@link #MAX_HEADER_SNAPSHOTS} (16 MB —
 * covers several dimensions' full discs at distance 512) with FIFO strip-and-relearn
 * eviction enforced OUTSIDE the owning monitors (one monitor held at a time — no
 * lock-order inversion; a stripped region costs one re-read on next demand).
