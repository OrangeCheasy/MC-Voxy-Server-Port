/**
 * Result of an async chunk disk read (or a generation outcome routed through the disk
 * pipeline). Pure-Java — shared verbatim by both platforms.
 *
 * <p>{@code saturated} means the disk reader pool rejected the task. It must never be
 * treated as "not found": the position is simply left unanswered (dropped silently and
 * counted superseded), and the client's next want-set re-declares it. {@code sectionBytes
 * == null} with {@code !notFound} is an all-air chunk (exists on disk, nothing visible).
 *
 * <p>{@code headerFresh} marks the header freshness rung's answer (P1, region-summary-
 * sync-plan.md): no bytes were read — {@code columnTimestamp} carries the proven
 * last-change second and delivery answers {@code up_to_date} per recipient whose stamp
 * strictly exceeds it (all other recipients take the standard transient drop).
 *
 * <p>{@code authoritativeMiss} distinguishes WHY {@code notFound} is set: {@code true}
 * means storage positively answered "no SERVABLE chunk" — the region lookup returned
 * empty, or the chunk exists but cannot serve LOD data (non-FULL proto-chunk, FULL with
 * no sections, a corrupt chunk MC's own read resolves null). All of these may seed the
 * miss memo: generation is the correct disposition for each (it completes/regenerates
 * the chunk, and every generation outcome clears the memo); {@code false} with
 * {@code notFound} means an error/timeout was TRIAGED down the not-found ladder (law A5's
 * {@code disk.errors} fold) — it says nothing about existence and must never be memoized,
 * or an existing chunk's reads would be suppressed for the memo TTL.
