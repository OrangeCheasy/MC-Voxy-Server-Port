/**
 * The NATIVE section-header shape descriptor (V-2/S1, version-port-isolation-plan.md §3):
 * the per-MC-line facts of the native section layout as first-class values, so a support
 * port edits THIS file instead of flavoring the cursor, both NBT serializers, and the
 * three relationship-pinning tests (the recorded ~134-line churn on the 1.21.11 port).
 *
 * <p>Four independent fields (the plan-review MAJOR said two; the V-2 execution
 * review added the cursor's line-level fold, and the 1.21.1 port found the long-array
 * prefix axis — one value cannot express the recorded flavor):
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #NATIVE_COUNT_SHORTS} — LINE-level, consumed by the cursor's parse+emit:
 *       how many count shorts the native section header carries after sectionY.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #NATIVE_LONG_ARRAY_PREFIXED} — LINE-level, consumed by the cursor's
 *       parse+emit: whether the native container long array carries a VarInt length
 *       prefix (1.21.1's vanilla {@code writeLongArray}) or bare words (26.x,
 *       1.21.11).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #foldedCountForNativeHeader} — LINE-level, the cursor emit's one-short
 *       value (client-side vanilla semantics; recorded 1.21.11: the sum).</li>
 *   <li>the family folds ({@link #foldedCountFabricFamily}/{@link #foldedCountPaperFamily})
 *       — PER-PLATFORM-FAMILY, consumed by each serializer's header sites: what VALUE a
 *       one-short header carries. On 1.21.11 Fabric's vanilla recalc writes
 *       {@code nonEmpty + fluid} while Paper's (Moonrise) recalc writes {@code nonEmpty}
 *       alone — same line, different fold.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>Scope hygiene (pinned by {@code NativeSectionShapeTest}):</b> this descriptor
 * carries NATIVE fields ONLY. The V20 layout is line-invariant wire spec — its two-short
 * count header and {@code V20_BLOCK_MAX_BITS}/{@code V20_BIOME_MAX_BITS} must NEVER
 * derive from here: a per-line edit there forks the never-tiered wire silently, and both
 * ends of that line would agree with each other.
